          I’m someone who documents smoking gun of my invariably fledgling with dilettante arrested development by being painfully wet behind the ears and all at sea, by vaguely detesting the emerging technology, idea of next-generation connectivity, augmented reality (and Mixed reality), humanoid, blockchains, IoT, AI and ML, but also being a tech-literate AI-savvy, enthralled by CRISPR, GIS, seismology, prototyping robotics, mark-up and logo (and even sometimes shader, like, as much as I like to commence ANSI art, ASCII art, point-vector art, i.e. only procrastination when comes to trying these) programming languages, and passionately enthralled by video gaming, synth metal/electro rock, and mixed-media aesthetic, low poly, dark fantasy digital art (with sometimes mixing impressionism art style with pixel art, or impressionism with vector art, baroque with voxel art, surrealism with voxel art, and fauvism with mesh polygonal art).
          <br><br>
          YESSS, FROM CODING TO RESEARCHING THE CONTENT IN THIS I DID EVERYTHING ALONE, moreover, it's also, my first attempt to do coding after graduating in my secondary education, which I checked, I actually used to score the highest in my class (section of 30 students) in these mark-up, logo and shading programming language. So yes! I did took help of AI, but this is not at all AI-generated (and, I don't have any proof if it, apart from this site being such an all sizzle no steak like a petulant child, and also, how  amateurely immature and pathetically research and review work, I did here, but, this all a study, I did before my I found myself a supervisor. After, I found her, then she guided aptly about what gaps are there, and I authored two books; so, this blog/this site practically the trash, that did not got published, and this is why I call it my Xeroth Approach To Academic Research, apart from the reason my favorite music group stated for naming this as their album, my this approach is also, somewhat similar to Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics). Also, I didn't know how to scroll this page left-right, that's why so many line breaks.

          I weaponize my incompetence, with insanely deep-rooted shortcomings towards reading/literature with plain text without any picture, social and political history, social and political sciences and urban studies, probably due to being measly knack in outlay, foreign policy, pitching project ideas, credit appraisals, retail assets, bookkeeping, enterprising, financial supervision, administrations and operations, venture capital, outlay, international relations, foreign policy, monetary dismal science, financial supervision, administrations and operations, data analysis, credit appraisals, retail assets, bookkeeping, enterprising, venture capital etc.; moreover, the wheel running but the hamster lying dead, when, managing human capital lifecycle by aligning organizational strategy with employee acquisition, development and legal compliance to optimize institutional performance, or having opinions that one would want to introspect and express by debating with other bookworms in the library, with the those attempts making my identity as someone with major egg on face, let alone urban political economy and policy governance, or, even tad-bit of pop-culture, let alone being chronically online or bingeing, and all this is as it is, until it’s not rural sociology and education/rural (as in the middle-gangetic plains) extension and development. I'm incessantly hyperactive at problematic level, I can dance, do exercise, play basketball, all day. But, creating these blogs and doing all these activities passionately like, I love to embarrass myself, by showing I suffer from Peter Pan Syndrome, creating something like this, so, unfledged, tenderfoot, despite being long in the foot as someone superannuated, which deserves a grade way below below nadir point, yet curating, instead of, acting like other responsible, smart, independent, girls of my age, wailing on my laziness when trying to be productive by training me self in stuff have shortcoming, or is measly knacky, who lived there sweet sixteen at 16, and not at 21, like me, who first squandered her entire life despite all the privelege, that's the kind of ungrateful brat I am, always jealous, bullying, pulling other's down, who are equivalent or more than it girl or that girl, embarassing myself, masquerading to be like the most pureile person in this universe, despite being younger to me is, like, even I am not even one percent, well-read, well-aware, hard-working, diligence of such girls, still delighted extant... though, I am guilty, that's why avowing.
