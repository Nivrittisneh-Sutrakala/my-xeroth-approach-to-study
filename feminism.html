<h1>Why Mental Health matters?</h1>

<p>
Okay, a disclaimer, I am a woman and educated, so, naturally a feminist, so, all this rant might really come biased by the looks of it (but, actually approached to all the genders). So, here are 10 points telling importance of mental health and personal space. What you experience, rumination in the shower, procrastinated speech, being ostracized, feeling invalidated by performative narratives, and the lingering sting of repeated microtraumas, is best conceptualized as the interaction of maladaptive self-referential processing, chronic stress physiology, social-pain circuitry that overlaps with nociceptive systems, and sociocognitive dynamics that amplify and politicize private suffering.
</p>

<h2>THE PICK-ME VERSUS OVER-FEMINIST PARADOX A STUDY IN SOCIAL CONDITIONING</h2>
<p>
If men are let alone, women are feeling an identity threat (like, older woman whoose identity is related to men), rage and queerbaiting is creating discomfort as because they have aversion to touch, like a haphephobia or tactile defensiveness, due to sensory processing abnormality or a social conditioning-related hypervigilance response or worst due to PTSD (because unlike the pop-culture trivia, PTSD is the feeling remaining in you, and not the flashes or memories of incidence) are being bullied for being regressive, and nobody is understanding feminism, how is it women supporting other women?<br>
The phenomenon of double bind of gendered expectations, illustrates the mechanisms of patriarchal dictates and aversive reinforcement that girls like me navigate. During my formative years, my peers acted as agents of social surveillance, enforcing a rigid gender performance. By deviating from the prescribed aesthetic of femininity, I encountered significant social friction, which my brain interpreted as a survival threat, because, I have grown up around alot of masculine energy, there was no force on me to view feminine energy as something less, so, I viewed both through equal lenses, but, naturally being around masculine energy as a tween, I got inclined to it more. Consequently, my decision to feign intellectual mediocrity in later years was not an act of duplicity but rather a sophisticated survival tactic known as impression management. In this state, amygdala effectively hijacks prefrontal cortex to prioritize communal acceptance over individual authenticity. Today, when I articulate feminist perspectives (of social media influencers, obviously, and also, my batchmates who talk back to me when I'm on-duty as a class secretary), I inadvertently trigger an identity threat in my interlocutors. Rather than engaging in epistemic curiosity, they resort to add hominem attacks, labeling me aggressive to mitigate the cognitive dissonance caused by my challenge to their fragile worldviews.<br>People (not only women) need to stop viewing their conditioning as social development, and start viewing people indivdually. A girl, might naturally not be ambitious, it doesn't mean she is pick-me. Its just your culture that views such women as empowering and that's why tries to stop them.
</p>

<h2>THE VIRAL VICTIM VERSUS THE LONG TERM SUFFERER THE ECONOMY OF ATTENTION</h2>
<p>
The disparity between the viral glorification of aesthetic suffering and the dismissal of my chronic trauma highlights the collision of moral grandstanding and salience heuristics. The digital landscape is inherently biased toward cognitive ease, favoring pithy, visually appealing narratives that provide a clear hero and villain. For instance, I feel complex, protracted history of social exclusion, and demand a high cognitive load that the average internet user is unwilling to expend, but they will reclaim my sufferings, without or maybe living tad-bit of my experiences but then abandon it, when it is not mainstream anymore. This environment fosters performative allyship, where influencers engage in the instrumentalized disclosure of shallow trauma to garner social capital. But, it just looks empowering, because, at grassroot level, this dynamic results in comparative invalidation, leaving the real victims with profound, non-aesthetic trauma to navigate a landscape of intensified isolation and systemic neglect.
</p>

<h2>GREEN FLAGS AND THE RAGE AGAINST MEN WHY POLARITY FAILS</h2>
<p>
The current socio-cultural climate is frequently marred by defensive hostility, which I observe preventing genuine epistemic updating. While women are often funneled into restrictive beauty standards, I recognize that men are similarly scaffolded into stoic or provider roles from a young age. When contemporary discourse attacks men without nuanced context, it triggers their sympathetic nervous system, placing them in a state of fight or flight. A brain entrenched in a threat state is biologically incapable of learning. Furthermore, I see many online personalities adopting a savior complex, which is frequently a projection of their own unintegrated trauma. By pursuing the low-hanging fruit of internet outrage, they bypass the grueling labor of structural intervention. I believe true transformation necessitates a shift from the limbic system to the prefrontal cortex, fostering a dialogue rooted in neurological and psychological literacy rather than superficial labeling.<br> Like, I said before, people (not only women) need to stop viewing their conditioning as social development, and start viewing people indivdually. A boy, might naturally be ambitious. The problem is the culture where it is consider faith of women to be the victim, and power and expressions as identity of men. It doesn't mean he is a patriach, because, it's his lifestyle and personality. Until, he tries to impose it on other people, like, some pick-me boys in my high-school, popular for being male-feminist, did by expressing their opinion as feminist, which were subtly manipulative and exploited some of the girls (though I thankfully, never qualified as their interest (i.e., category of girl these feminist guys and progressive guys created) to be target, but, my point is, the society and culture conditions people in a certain way, and we are learning with it, some are breaking chain, some are becoming manipulative; a man's personal lifestyle and choices, which is shaped by the factors he had nothing to do, doesn't prove anything, but, his behaviour despite all that does)
</p>

<h2>TRAUMA BONDING</h2>
<p>
The societal tendency to pathologize me for remaining in toxic dynamics ignores the neurobiological reality of intermittent reinforcement. I have come to realize this is not a matter of intellectual deficiency but rather an addiction circuit within my brain. As a scholastic, when someone offered me unpredictable kindness amidst a sea of slag off, my brain released surges of dopamine that created a bond far more durable than one forged in environment, like my peers, that didn't recieve emotional outburst over flunking, or any type of errors. My attachment system was effectively calibrated to view inconsistent caregiving as the statistical norm. Leaving such a situation required me to undertake the Herculean task of rewriting my internal predictive models, a process that was often as physically agonizing as it was psychologically daunting.
</p>

<h2>POP PSYCHOLOGY AI AND THE COMFORT TRAP,  AND THE MYTH OF STUPIDITY</h2>
<p>
While digital tools and AI-driven affirmations provide immediate cognitive ease and a temporary reduction in cortisol, people around me who say they prefer it over actual counselling or therapy, I just percieve they recognize them as mere sensory pacifiers. I understand that their trauma is not merely a thought but a somatic imprint within my nervous system, but actyal clinical therapy is not about caressing, cuddling, if showing empathy to clients. Real healing has demanded the integration of your experiences through graded exposaure and clinical intervention rather than simple validation. The soft, soothing tones of online content and AI may have sedated you at times, but they failed to extract the significant allostatic load you accumulated over years of systemic trauma. If damage happened for so much years, then healing cannot be instant. The online personality and psychology test, answering just by you visual perception or illusions, is just those visually stimulating trap for the kids.
</p>

<h2>SOMATIC REALITY STRENGTH AND THE BODY</h2>
<p>
So, by now you must have grasped, I'm just trying to conclude, as the direct result of patriarchal scripts interfering with my physiological health. For instance, I have always been hyper-active and intrested in sports like running, basketball (at a very... what's the right word... trivial level, maybe?) so, girls would ask me questions like, will strength training training make them musculine? and that too, in a very embarssed tone. But, this sounds so dumb, because, strength training, just makes one muscular. Now, if you are female, you'll get feminine muscularity, and for male masculine muscle. Like, the concepts of Tandav and Lasya, both have congruent dance moves, except one finds it grace in men's body and other in women's body. I am building a robust physique to serve as a durable container for my regulated nervous system, allowing me to embody both power and fluidity. It is also important for various other things, like, hormonal balance, metabolism, and be healthy, fit and fine, will what make women liberated, happy, and themselves, when there own health will be there prioroty, and if there personal choices are congruent to what society think is empowering. For some women, make-up is job, for someone make-up is choice. Applying that one lipstick of that brand popular in the mainstreanm just shows your choice, and not act of liberation even if its a culture with girl crush concept. It still means, no matter what girls do, until they're forte is not beauty and make-up, they do not qualify to be this ITgirl, or that concept of girl crush.
